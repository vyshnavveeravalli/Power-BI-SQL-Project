The objective of this project is to create a comprehensive sales report for a pizza restaurant using Power BI and SQL. The report will provide insights into various aspects of the business, including sales performance, popular pizza types, customer demographics, and sales trends over time. By leveraging Power BI's visualization capabilities and SQL for data manipulation, this project aims to empower decision-makers with actionable insights to optimize business operations and drive growth.

Extracted sales data from the restaurant's database using SQL queries. The dataset includes information such as sales transactions, pizza types, customer details, order timestamps, and sales revenue.

Cleansed the extracted data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Performed necessary transformations such as data type conversion, handling missing values, and formatting dates. Additionally, create any calculated fields required for analysis.
